// core-commit — commit and push crunchyCore, then pull it into this app: the core-first order in one step.
//
//   node tools/core-commit.mjs          (the VS Code task "Commit crunchyCore, then pull it here" runs this)
//
// A CORE FILE: canonical in crunchyCore/tools/, copied into each app by tools/pull-core.mjs. Run from the app.
//
// Why it exists (crunchyTile TILE-DESIGN.md §111): an app's pre-commit hook refuses copies pulled from an uncommitted
// core, so a change that spans the core and an app must go core first. AJ asked whether a hook could do that itself;
// a hook cannot ask, would sweep in whatever else is in the core, and could push the core and then fail the app. This
// does the same in the open: it SHOWS what will be committed, runs the core's tests, asks for the core's own message
// and a yes, then commits, pushes, and pulls. It stops at the first thing that fails, saying where it stopped.
//
// It never commits the APP: that stays yours, with your message, after this finishes. It never stages anything in the
// app either (index.html may hold your own unstaged work); the changed files show in the Source Control panel.
